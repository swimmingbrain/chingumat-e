## How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chingumate.git
cd chingumate
```

## Step 2: Set Up the Raspberry Pi

- Connect the foot button GPIO pins as follows:
  - **Button 1 (Left)**: GPIO 12
  - **Button 2 (Up)**: GPIO 16
  - **Button 3 (Down)**: GPIO 20
  - **Button 4 (Right)**: GPIO 21

### Step 3: Start the Server

Run the Python script to monitor GPIO states and serve data to the web interface:

```bash
python3 gpio_server.py
```

### Step 4: Start the Local Web Server

Serve the game files using a simple Python HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### Step 5: Play the Game

1. Access the game in your browser from your PC:
   ```
   http://<raspberry-ip>:8000/index.html
   ```

2. Step on the foot buttons to match the rhythm and enjoy the game!

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, GPIO-connected aluminum puzzle mats
- **Design**: Neon-inspired UI, custom animations
